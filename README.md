# hello-world
## My first repository.
### I am from China. I am a girl who loves computer science. When I touch firstly computer science, I am excited and curious. Gradually, I am a little confused because I     find it hard to me. But I can't give up so I insist on it all the time. We cheer up together and welcome you to share your experience.
