Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
    
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
The background color should be `#ffffff` for light mode and `#0d1117` for dark mode.
